## STEP 1: Find Your Topic for the TERM PAPER

Either it is given to you by HOD or You‚Äôve to Decide Yourself.

## STEP 2: Google Dorking for the Topic

Initially we‚Äôll find some research papers which are already published on the Internet, the goal is to find at least 4 such papers which we‚Äôll use to create an outline and generate the content for our own document.

{% hint style="info" %}
Make Sure to replace the <> with your own topic.

üîç filetype:pdf \<YOUR TOPIC NAME>
{% endhint %}

## STEP 3: Creating an Outline for the Term Paper

Now let‚Äôs create a structured outline which will list down the topics, subtopics and micro-topics within the outline. For this we‚Äôll use one Research Journal which we‚Äôve already found in the STEP 2, Make Sure this is the best one out of all. Head over to [www.chatgpt.com](http://www.chatgpt.com) and create an account, Start a New Chat and Enter this Prompt by Replacing the Topic name in the ++CONTEXT++, also attach a PDF of the best research Journal you‚Äôve found on your Topic.

++INSTRUCTIONS++
"I am an undergraduate BTECH student at an Indian university and I need help outlining a research paper. Please provide me with a structured outline for my chosen topic, including suggested chapters and what should be included in each chapter. I am only looking for the outline and not the actual content.

++CONTEXT++
My topic is 'ENTER YOUR TOPIC HERE'

++REFERENCES++
I'm also attaching a PDF which is a research paper on the same, Pick topics for the outline from this document along with your own thought process.

++OUTLINE-STRUCTURE++
After you've created the outline, I want you to cluster all the outline in a proper arrangement and fit it into these "Main headings":
-Introduction 								     
-Review of Literature and Definition of Problem
-Materials and Methods
-Results and Discussion
-Conclusion and Future Prospects				
-Summary

NOTE: Although New "Main Headings" Can be added at a suitable position but keep those 6 mentioned above preserved.

Let's think step by step.
