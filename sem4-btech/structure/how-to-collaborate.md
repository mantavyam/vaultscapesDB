# How to Collaborate ?

Vaultscapes is an academic resource-sharing platform designed to encourage collaboration and contribution from educators, students, and professionals. We provide two simple methods for contributing to our growing repository. Choose the one that suits you best!

### 1. User-Friendly Method

This is the easiest way to contribute without needing any technical knowledge.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
Scroll to the bottom of any page on the website.


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Click on the embedded URL labeled **"Collaborate on Vaultscapes"**.


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Fill out the form that appears. You can:

* Describe the resource youâ€™re sharing.
* Attach relevant documents or files (PDFs, Word documents, images, etc.).
* Optionally, provide your identification details if you'd like credit for your contribution.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Once you submit the form, your contribution will be reviewed by us, and, upon approval, added to Vaultscapes.

### 2. Developer Method

If youâ€™re familiar with GitHub and its contribution mechanisms, this method allows you to directly edit the repository.

#### Quick Overview of GitHub Contribution Terms:

* **Pull Request (PR)**: A request to merge your changes into the main project.
* **Fork**: Your personal copy of the repository where you can experiment freely.
* **Branch**: A version of the repository where you make changes before submitting them.
* **Issue**: A way to report problems, suggest features, or ask questions.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Navigate to the Relevant GitHub File**

* On any Vaultscapes page, look for the option **"Edit on GitHub"** located on the **right-hand side**.
* Clicking this will take you to the specific markdown file in our GitHub repository: [https://github.com/mantavyam/vaultscapes](https://github.com/mantavyam/vaultscapes)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Edit the File**

* **Sign in to GitHub**: If youâ€™re not signed in, log in or create a free GitHub account.
* **Click the Pencil Icon**: This is the "Edit this file" button, allowing you to modify the file directly on the website.
* **Make Changes**: Add or update the content as needed. For example:
  * Add resources or new sections.
  * Fix typos or grammatical errors.
  * Suggest improvements to the page.
* **Write a Commit Message**: In the box at the bottom of the page, summarize what youâ€™ve changed (e.g., "Added notes on Database Design" or "Fixed typos in Module 1").
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Submit Your Changes**

**Option A: Open an Issue (Suggest Without Editing)**

1. If you donâ€™t want to edit directly but have an idea or suggestion, go to the **Issues** tab in the repository.
2. Click **New Issue**.
3. Write a clear title and description of your suggestion.
4. Attach any relevant files or links, if needed.

**Option B: Create a Pull Request (PR)**

1. Once youâ€™ve made your edits, select the option **"Create a new branch for this commit"**.
2. Provide a branch name (e.g., `add-resource-CSE204`).
3. Click **Propose changes**.
4. After this, youâ€™ll see the option to open a **Pull Request**.
5. Describe your changes in detail and submit the PR. The team will review your changes and merge them if they align with Vaultscapesâ€™ goals.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
