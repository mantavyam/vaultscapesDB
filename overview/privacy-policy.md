# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 16, 2026

This Privacy Policy applies to the Vaultscapes app (hereinafter referred to as the "Application"), accessible via web link or mobile devices, created by Shivam Singh (hereinafter referred to as the "Service Provider") as an Open Source service. This service is provided "AS IS".

**Access Without Account**\
The Application does not require account creation or registration to use its core features.

* When accessing via web link, the Application is immediately available with no sign-in needed.
* On mobile, you can download and use the Application fully without authentication. By default, the Application opens to the general homepage.

**Optional Authentication (Mobile Only)**\
For user convenience, the mobile version offers an optional sign-in feature using Google OAuth or GitHub OAuth. This is entirely skippable — you can continue using the Application without signing in.\
Signing in allows you to set personal preferences, such as selecting your semester number to customize the homepage with relevant content for that semester instead of the default view.

If you choose to sign in:

* The Application receives only limited profile information from the chosen provider (typically your name, username, and/or email address) strictly to enable this personalization feature.
* No additional personal data is requested or collected.
* This information is used solely to apply your preferences within the Application and is not used for marketing, analytics, or any other purpose.

**Information Collection and Use**\
When using the Application without signing in (web or mobile), no personal information is collected or stored.\
When signed in (optional, mobile only), the limited provider-provided information is used only for the personalization feature described above.

**Does the Application collect precise real-time location information?**\
No. The Application does not collect any location data from your device.

**Third-Party Access**

* No data is shared with third parties except during optional sign-in, where Google or GitHub acts solely as the authentication provider.
* The chosen provider may receive standard OAuth authentication details, but the Application does not share any additional user data with them or any other party.

**Data Storage and Security**\
Any optional preference data linked to your chosen sign-in provider is stored securely and only for the purpose of personalizing your experience. The Service Provider takes reasonable measures to protect this limited information, though no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

**Opt-Out and Data Management**

* You can stop all data processing by skipping sign-in or by revoking access through your Google/GitHub settings and uninstalling the Application.
* Standard uninstall processes available on your device or app marketplace may be used.
* To delete any stored preferences linked to your optional account, contact the Service Provider.

**Children**\
The Application does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Users must be at least 16 years old (or have parental consent where required) to use the optional sign-in feature.

**Changes**\
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with a new effective date. Continued use of the Application after changes constitutes acceptance.

**Your Consent**\
By using the Application, you consent to this Privacy Policy.
